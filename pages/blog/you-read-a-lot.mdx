Does this sound familiar? That's the reason I'm not writing on Medium. Yes, why the hell I have to pay FIVE DAMN dollars to read stories on Medium? You could buy an iPhone X only for two hundred of those 5 dollars.

I want my scientific stories with over 18k claps FFF. F\*ing For Free, in case you haven't heared that (because I made it up right now)

# What's wrong with you?

What would you do if you didn't have a starting post for your blog? Can you even understand my feelings? ðŸ˜¢

When I have had dozens of ideas last week. The moment I finished building the blog, I have no idea what should I write about. ðŸ˜¿

# I was joking

I was joking about Medium. I was going to pay the $5 finally, but, didn't! Why would I give myself another way of procrastinating? I don't mean they're not valuable, but, not more than my long-standing, unfinished Kindle books.

I'd rather to finish one of them first. Plus, they don't put me in an endless loop of "Recommended" articles.

# Nothing more? Oh, Instagram!

Today I **uninstalled Instagram** after I realized it **only** makes me less happy. You can [follow me](https://www.instagram.com/m.rajbi/) on Instagram, cause I'm sure I'll be back ðŸ¤ª Haven't decided on IGTV yet, though.

I promise I'll be writing real posts here. Like, those "Essays" [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html) and [Guillermo Rauch](https://rauchg.com/essays) wrote.

Oh my god, that sounds terrifying ðŸ˜¨, I'll just write "more normal" bite-sized posts ðŸ˜‹
