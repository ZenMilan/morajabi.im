Does this sound familiar? Yes, Medium. That's the reason I'm not writing on Medium. I don't like them. Yes, why the hell I have to pay FIVE dollars to read, those called, "Member-only" stories on Medium? I've seen you change logos two times, and I'm not a member now? Thanks.

You could buy an iPhone X only for two hundreds of those 5 dollars.

I want my scientific stories with lots and lots of claps FFFFFF. Means F\*ing For Free For F\*s Fake (Sake? Maybe), in case you haven't heard that (Might be because I made it up right now)

# What's wrong with you?

Let me start this way. What would you do if you didn't have a starting post for your blog? Can you even understand my feelings? ðŸ˜¢

When I have had dozens of ideas last week. The moment I finished building the blog, I have no idea what should I write about. ðŸ˜¿

# Ah, Medium? I like it

I was joking about Medium (We all knew, boooring). I was going to pay the $5 today, finally. But, didn't! Why would I give myself another way of procrastinating? I don't mean they're not valuable, but, not more than my long-awaited, unfinished Kindle books. (Long-`await`'ed? Async? But this supposed to be a non-programming post ðŸ¤­)

I'd rather to finish one of them first. Plus, they don't put me in an endless loop of "Recommended" articles.

# Anything else? Oh, Instagram!

Now that we're talking shit, let me mention this, too. Today I **uninstalled Instagram** after I realized it **only** makes me less happy. Why the hell though? It can probably be a post, too. At least it'd be better than this one.

You can [follow me](https://www.instagram.com/m.rajbi/) on Instagram, cause I'm sure I'll be back sometime soon ðŸ¤ª Haven't decided on IGTV yet, though.

So, here we go, I promise I'll be writing real posts here. Like, those "Essays" [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html) and [Guillermo Rauch](https://rauchg.com/essays) wrote.

Oh my god, that sounds terrifying ðŸ˜¨, I'll just write "more normal" bite-sized posts ðŸ˜‹
